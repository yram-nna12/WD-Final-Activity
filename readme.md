## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Introducing my v.2 personal website, a carefully constructed digital portfolio that reflects my passion for web design and programming. This project is an integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript expertise; it provides a tour across many websites intended to showcase both technical mastery and artistic vision. Every page is carefully designed to offer users a smooth navigation experience and simple access to information that resembles a résumé and describes my experience, education, and talents.This website's main feature is a dedicated project exhibition, where I gladly provide a hand-picked collection of previous work. Every project entry showcases my ability to create reliable online apps and includes a thorough explanation, links to repositories, and information about the technologies used. The website's design philosophy highlights simple aesthetics and user-friendly interfaces, highlighting my dedication to creating outstanding digital experiences.

This website is not just a demonstration of technical skills, but also of creativity and uniqueness in web building. Every component of my project, from captivating visual layouts to responsive design features, tries to fascinate and educate visitors about my talents and accomplishments. This personal website aims to make a lasting impression, encouraging you to explore the junction of design brilliance and practical elegance, whether you're looking through my portfolio or learning more about my professional experience.

Technologically, the project leverages HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling to ensure aesthetic appeal and responsiveness across devices, and JavaScript for enhancing user interactions such as dynamic content loading or animations. The use of media queries ensures that the webpage adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, optimizing usability and engagement.
